# About Project
This is Assessment 3 for the paper IT5016D Software Development Fundamentals. It includes my research and projects that I have carried out during my coding journey with Python.

# Motivation
This project has been created as a way to look back on the coding that I have learnt and the exercises I have completed using Python. It will help me find specific coding blocks that I can refer to for future projects.
