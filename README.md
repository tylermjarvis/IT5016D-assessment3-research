# About Project
This is Assessment 3 for the paper IT5016D Software Development Fundamentals. It includes my research and projects that I have carried out during my coding journey with Python.


# Motivation
This project has been created as a way to look back on the coding that I have learnt and the exercises I have completed using Python and the Software Development learning activities.
With these example exercises that I have used to practice, I will delve into how they work with common Python design patterns and principles.
The repo will also help me find specific coding blocks that I can refer to for future projects.

# Common Python Design Patterns
Singleton pattern - This pattern restricts instantiation to just one instance of a class.

Factory method pattern - This is a creational pattern that uses a factory method to create objects without specifying the exact class of that object.

Adapter pattern - This pattern allows the interface (a class that defines methods that can be overridden) of a class to be used as another interface. It is used to make exisiting classes work with other classes, without changing their source code.

Builder pattern - The builder pattern is used to separate the construction of an object with multiple layers using a step by step build pattern.

Facade pattern - This pattern allows us to carry out subtasks within a class that can call these subtasks. Therefore acting as the face of this subsystem.


# Navigation
Each folder is broken down into the syntax of Python code and the design patterns that work with that syntax. Through this syntax, the exploration of Python Design Patterns is explored further. For example, creation patterns are explored within the classes folder due to the initialisation stage that can be refracted to best suit the scenario and therefore be a more efficient program. Each folder contains Python files with practice code and comments, Python files using Python design patterns, Screenshots and a ReadMe with an over view of the folder and those design patterns used.

Folder structure:
Bools - Behavioural design patterns such as the Mediator patern and Decorator pattern.

Classes - Creational patterns such as Factory method pattern and Facade pattern.
